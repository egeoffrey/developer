# Overview

Generally speaking, making up your contribution to eGeoffrey is made up of three phases:

* **Develop**: in which you create your custom package code which is then published to a Github repository
* **Build**: in which you build up the Docker image of your package out of your code which is then published to Docker Hub
* **Distribute**: in which your publish your contribution to the eGeoffrey Marketplace

But before getting in details into these phases, we need to understand a bit more how eGeoffrey's code is structured, how to leverage the SDK, what are best practices for versioning your code, etc.
