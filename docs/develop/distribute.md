1. Ensure the latest source code of your package is in your own Github repository and the Docker image published to your Dockerhub account
1. **Request for your package to be published** to the eGeoffrey Marketplace
    * Go to `https://github.com/egeoffrey/egeoffrey-marketplace/tree/master/marketplace`
    * Click on `Create new file`
    * Name the file as your package name with a `yml` extension (e.g. `egeoffrey-service-example.yml`)
    * The file content should have a single line in the format `github: <git_username>/<git_repository>`
    * Save the file; this will trigger a PR (Pull Request) 
    * Once your request will be merged, your package will be available for all the other eGeoffrey users!
1. If you are releasing a new version of a package there is no need to repeat the procedure above: it is up the Marketplace to always provide the most up to date content
