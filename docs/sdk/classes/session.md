# The Session Class

*Python SDK, Javascript SDK*

Communicating through a message bus introduce additional complexity since the response is asynchronous and not linked with a specific request (like instead could be a REST API call). To help developers in matching a response with a previously sent request, the Session class keeps track of session information (e.g. whatever attribute you need to save) when communicating with other modules. This leverages a a random `request_id` which is automatically generated by the SDK when creating a new `Message` object.
 
The following functions are provided:

* `register(message, session)`: associate the request_id of a message with a session content
* `restore(message)`: return session's content previously saved of a an incoming message (be leveraging the associated request_id)
* `is_registered(message)`: return true if this is a registered session, false otherwise
